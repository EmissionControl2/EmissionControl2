-----------GUI ISSUES-------------

1. Unsure of the use of the RangeSlider found in the Joystick class. 

2. CloudTest2.scd and CloudTest3.scd can't run. Parameter/Modulation slider's methods are not understood. I think it's because no control set is given.
	- Yes, this was the issue. An in depth explanation of Control Sets would be quite helpful.  

3. Color gradients for the GUI are not supported in current implementation of Supercollider.

---------- UGEN ISSUE ------------

1. RCloud cannot be succesfully compiled (need source code??)
	- Terminal output of all scd files using RCloud found in current folder as a png. 

2. Unsure if modulation sliders work on not. I see no pattern based implementation for different types. I think all modulation is done on the server side. 


Notes: 

-PresetTEST and PresetInterpolatorTEST are not using GUI elements to test the preset functionality. 

-Deprecated NumberBox2. The current iteration of Supercollider has implemented all of the features of your EC's NumberBox2 into the native NumberBox. 

-Changed the name of Tilt to ECTilt due to a naming conflict with a spatialization plugin found in the SC3plugins package.
