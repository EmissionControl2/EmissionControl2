-----------GUI ISSUES-------------

1. Must implement slider labels. 

2. Unsure of the use of the RangeSlider found in the Joystick class. 

3. CloudTest2.scd and CloudTest3.scd can't run. Parameter/Modulation slider's methods are not understood. I think it's because no control set is given.
	- Yes, this was the issue. An in depth explanation of Control Sets would be quite helpful.  

4. Color gradients for the GUI are not supported in current implementation of Supercollider.

5. draw methods for StaticText objects broken. I cannot figure out how to allow for mouse actions to go through static text box.
---------- UGEN ISSUE ------------

2. RCloud cannot be succesfully compiled (need source code??)
	- Terminal output of all scd files using RCloud found in current folder as a png. 

3. Unsure if modulation sliders work on not. I see no pattern based implementation for different types. I think all modulation is done on the server side. 


Notes: 

-PresetTEST and PresetInterpolatorTEST are not using GUI elements to test the preset functionality. 

-Deprecated NumberBox2. The current iteration of Supercollider has implemented all of the features of your EC's NumberBox2 into the native NumberBox. 

-Changed the name of Tilt to ECTilt due to a naming conflict with a spatialization plugin found in the SC3plugins package.
