Features include:

- Granulation of multiple sound files simultaneously
- Multiple simultaneous grain streams
- Synchronous and asynchronous grain emission
- Intermittency control
- Per-grain signal processing (envelope, waveform, amplitude, frequency, spatial position, filter center frequency and resonance)
- Unique filter design optimized for per-grain synthesis
- Matrix modulation control of all granulation parameters with six LFOs
- Real-time display of peak amplitude, grain counter, waveform, and scan range
- Scalable GUI and font size
- MIDI Learn enables mapping to any MIDI continuous controller.
- Code is open source and available at GitHub
- Maximal "Grain Integrity" (tm)
